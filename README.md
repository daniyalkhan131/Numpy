# Numpy

numpy for high level mathematical functions
use multidimensional arrays and fn operate on arrays
basically all about matrices, have poowerful functn for matrices

python have 9 datastructure while numpy has only 1 ie nD array
nD array is homogenous like c array
we use it for only numbers, can store strings but we never use that way
fixed size, need to tel first, not like adding afterwards


pandas inherently use numpy in there calc.
